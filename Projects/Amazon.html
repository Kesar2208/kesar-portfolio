    <h1>Analyzing Amazon Sales Data</h1>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This project, titled "Analyzing Amazon Sales data," involved a deep dive into Amazon's sales data to uncover key performance indicators (KPIs), identify trends, and discover opportunities to optimize profitability across various product types, regions, and countries. Sales management is a crucial function in commercial enterprises today, essential for meeting increased competition and improving distribution methods to reduce costs and boost profits. The project aimed to provide actionable insights for sales management to develop a clear strategy for sustained growth. This data analytics project falls under the "E-commerce" domain and is classified as "Advanced" in difficulty.<br><br>
    Tools Used: Tableau<br>
    My Role: Data Analyst

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The core business problem addressed by this project is the need for effective sales management to navigate increasing competition and improve distribution methods, ultimately aiming to reduce costs and increase profits.<br><br>
    The primary objectives of this analysis were to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Perform ETL on an Amazon dataset.</li>
      <li> Identify sales trends (month-wise, year-wise, yearly-month-wise).</li>
      <li> Find key metrics and factors related to sales performance.</li>
      <li> Show meaningful relationships between attributes in the dataset.</li>
      <li> Uncover opportunities to optimize profitability across product types, regions, and countries.</li>
      <li> Explore total costs per sale and country-specific profit margins.</li>
      <li> Develop a clear strategy to drive sustained growth.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Dataset Description</h2>
    <p>The analysis was performed on an Amazon sales dataset. The dataset is accessible via a provided link for download. The specific features and granularity of the dataset are inferred from the analysis objectives, including information necessary to determine:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Sales trends over time (years and months).</li>
      <li> Costs and profits at an item level and country level.</li>
      <li> Data by item type (e.g., Cosmetics, Household, Office Supplies, Baby Food, etc.).</li>
      <li> Regional and country-wise profit distribution.</li>
      <li> Total units sold, total cost, total items, total amount, average total revenue, and average total profit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Approach Taken</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Data Acquisition:</strong> The Amazon sales dataset was obtained from the provided link.</li>
      <li><strong>ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) (Python):</strong><br>
        o Extract: Retrieving raw sales data from the source.<br>
        o Transform: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, standardizing formats, and possibly creating new features or aggregating data for analysis. This includes preparing data to analyze sales trends month-wise, year-wise, and yearly-month-wise.<br>
        o Load: Loading the processed data into a format suitable for visualization tools like Tableau.</li>
      <li><strong>KPI Definition and Calculation:</strong><br>
        o Calculated Revenue Growth<br>
        o Determined Profit Margins<br>
        o Analyzed Customer Acquisition<br>
        o Calculated Inventory Turnover</li>
      <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Identify distributions, trends, and outliers.</li>
      <li><strong>Dashboard Design & Visualization (Tableau):</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li> Year-wise total cost, total profit, and total revenue (Image 2)</li>
        <li> Item type total cost and total profit (Image 3)</li>
        <li> Item-wise profit (Image 4)</li>
        <li> Region-wise profit (Image 5)</li>
        <li> Country-wise profit map (Image 6)</li>
        <li> Total cost of items per sales channel (Image 7)</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Insight Generation & Recommendations:</strong> Final interpretations and strategic suggestions.</li>
    </ol>
