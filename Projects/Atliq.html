    <h1>AtliQ Hospitality Data Analysis</h1>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>AtliQ Grands, a chain of five-star hotels across India with 20 years in the hospitality industry, has been experiencing a decline in market share and revenue due to competitor strategies and ineffective management decisions. To counteract this, the managing director initiated a strategic move to integrate "Business and Data Intelligence" into their operations. This project, "AtliQ Hospitality Analysis," was undertaken by a third-party service provider to provide crucial insights from historical data, as AtliQ Grands lacks an in-house data analytics team. The project aims to empower AtliQ Grands with data-driven decision-making to regain its market position and boost revenue in the luxury/business hotel category. This data analytics project falls under the "Travel and Tourism" domain and is classified as "Advanced" in difficulty.<br><br>
    Tools Used: Tableau, Excel<br>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The core business problem faced by AtliQ Grands was the loss of market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category due to competitive pressures and internal decision-making shortcomings. The primary objective of this project was to leverage "Business and Data Intelligence" to address this challenge.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide actionable insights from AtliQ Grands' historical data to their revenue management team.</li>
      <li>To analyze key metrics such as Revenue, Occupancy Rate, and Average Rating across various properties, cities, and booking statuses.</li>
      <li>To identify trends in revenue by day type (weekday/weekend) and city.</li>
      <li>To understand successful booking patterns by city and day type and analyze conversion rates.</li>
      <li>To develop an interactive dashboard that allows filtering by properties, city, status, platform, month, and week to facilitate granular analysis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Dataset Description</h2>
    <p>The analysis relied on AtliQ Grands' historical data. While the specific structure and content of the datasets are not fully detailed in the provided documents, it is implied that the data includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Booking information: platform, room class, category, city, day type, and week number.</li>
      <li>Financial data: including revenue figures.</li>
      <li>Performance metrics: rating, cancellation rate, occupancy rate, bookings, capacity.</li>
